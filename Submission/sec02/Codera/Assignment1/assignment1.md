## Objectives

 In our system of hospital management, we aim at revolutionising how healthcare professionals manage and monitor patients' records in hospitals. In order to provide a comprehensive solution for dealing with the complexities of healthcare data, this system will use an appropriate class called "Patient," in which related attributes are included. Below are the overarching objectives of our system.<br>

 The development of a system that will enable healthcare professionals to obtain quick and reliable access to patients' data is central to our aim. Attributes include basic information such as names, identification ICs, age, sex, number of contacts, diagnosed diseases and relevant dates. The system improves the tracking of patients' records through centralised information, which will contribute to a more efficient and organised healthcare environment.<br>


 Our system is designed to take into account the various information needs of healthcare professionals, including dynamic search capabilities. By selecting attributes that are relevant to their search criteria, users will be able to locate specific patient records. The use of the bimodal search methodology, which delivers timely and precise results while making information retrieval more efficient, improves the procedure for searching.<br>


 Moreover, our system is flexible with regards to sorting and searching, so as to meet the different needs of healthcare professionals. Users can choose from a selection of special attributes that correspond to their particular requirements, enabling them to customize the process. This adaptability ensures that this system is compatible with the unique way in which health professionals work, thus making it more user friendly and efficient.<br>


Ultimately, our Hospital Management System aims to optimize healthcare workflows.  The system will make it easier for healthcare staff to devote more time and effort to the management of patient records, thereby enabling them to better take care of patients. This improvement is intended to contribute to a more streamlined and efficient healthcare environment. Essentially, our hospital management system is designed to deliver a simple solution specifically for the needs of health professionals who wish to improve their control and monitoring of patients' records at medical facilities.<br>
