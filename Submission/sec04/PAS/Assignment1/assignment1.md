## Objectives :bulb:
We have outlined a few objectives for this task, which are crucial in order to provide a guideline that facilitates an efficient execution of the tasks. These said objectives are are as follows:
  - To develop a library management system that can conduct sorting and searching processes based on certain criteria.
  - To develop a system that is user-friendly and produce an output display that is neat and comprehensive.
  - To develop the system using C++ programming language.
  - To ensure that the developed system can run efficiently and effectively.

## Synopsis :page_facing_up:
The Library Management System is designed to manage and view the library’s books that have attributes of book identification, title, author’s name, genre and year of publication. In Assignment 1, the system provides two main functions which are sorting and searching data. The sorting function will arrange the library’s books data, either in an ascending or descending order, based on specific criteria, such as book id, title, author, genre or the publication’s year. The selection algorithm is used to sort the data in either ascending or descending order. The searching function allows users to find a specific book in the library system. They can search for the book based on criteria such as book id, title, author, genre or year.
