<li>To simulate an actual Hotel Booking System in a way that administrators can use it to manage the room bookings in a hotel.</li>
<li>To improve understanding and enhance application of data structures: sorting and searching in a real-world scenario.</li>
<li>To utilize file mechanisms in C++ to read and write data from/ to external files as a simulation of the database of the system.</li>

Voting Management System is a system that can help students to view the candidates information like name, faculty, age, matric number, phone number and vote count. There is also a sorting and searching algorithm implemented in the system so that students have an easier time looking for the candidates. For example, students can search for the candidates from their faculty so that they can support the candidate from their faculty. There is also sorting that will arrange the candidates in ascending or descending order depending on the information they want to sort. For example, students can see the candidates from oldest to youngest or vice versa. This system will ease students in their search for candidates as all candidates are registered in the system.
