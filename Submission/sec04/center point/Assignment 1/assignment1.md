# Inventory Management System - Assignment 1
## Objective
In our data structure and algorithm assignment 1, the main objectives of developing the Inventory management system are :

🗄️𝐓𝐨 𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐢𝐧 𝐚 𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐞

🗂️𝐓𝐨 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐲 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐬𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐢𝐪𝐮𝐞 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦


## Synopsis📝

The inventory management system is essential for one business or organization to track or manage its warehouse. Our inventory management system is designed to 𝘀𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 or 𝗼𝗿𝗴𝗮𝗻𝗶𝘇𝗲 (𝘀𝗼𝗿𝘁) the inventory by its certain keys such as 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲, 𝗻𝗮𝗺𝗲, 𝘁𝘆𝗽𝗲, 𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗶𝘁𝘆, 𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗲 in either 𝗮𝘀𝗰𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝗿 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗰𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗼𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗿. These two methods are important because they not only save time but also offer convenience to users in managing the inventory effectively.



## Flow of Event 💹

1. User will be displayed the inventory list including all the inventory details: code, name, type, quantity and price. User will be directed to the main menu of the inventory management system. In the main menu user can choose either want to sort or search inventory as well as exit the program.

2. If the user click on the sorting option, the system will redirect the user to the next sort menu where the user can choose to sort the data in either of these manner which are:

    1. code
    2. name 
    3. type
    4. quantity
    5. price
       
3. The system will redirect the user to the next order menu where the user can choose to sort the data in either ascending or descending order.

4. After choosing the options, the system will show the output based on the option that have been chosen by the user.

5. The user would be back to the main menu to have their next operations.

6. If the user click on the searching option, the system will redirect the user to the next search menu where the user can choose to search the data in either manner of code or name.

7. After choosing the option, the system will ask the user to key in the search key
  
8. The system will show the output based on the option and search key that have been entered by the user.
   
9. The user would be back to the main menu to have their next operations.

10. The user can exit to the program when user choose exit option in main menu

11. All the inventory list data would be stored in output file.
